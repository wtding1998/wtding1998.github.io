I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in school of data science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). I am fortunately advised by Prof. Shuzhong Zhang, Prof. Zizhuo Wang and Dr. Jianze Li. Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

## Research Interest
- Tensor Optimization
- Manifold Optimization

## Publication
- Wentao Ding, Jianze Li, Shuzhong Zhang, [*Projectively and weakly simultaneously diagonalizable matrices and their applications*](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/22M1507656), 2024, SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications.

  *This work proposes several new variants of the simultaneous diagonalization of matrices. We derive various sufficient and/or necessary conditions of the new notions under different assumptions, revealing some interesting relationships between them.*

## Preprint
- Wentao Ding, Jianze Li, Shuzhong Zhang, [*Convergence analysis of the transformed gradient projection algorithms on compact matrix manifolds*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19392), 2024, arXiv:2404.19392.

  *This work introduces a general framework called Transformed Gradient Projection to solve the smooth optimization problems on compact submanifolds, which not only encompasses the existing algorithms but also induces new cases. We establish its weak convergence, global convergence and convergence rate by some novel inequalities about the projection onto submanifolds.*
